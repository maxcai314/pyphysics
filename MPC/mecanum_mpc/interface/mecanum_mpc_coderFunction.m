% [OUTPUTS] = mecanum_mpc(INPUTS) solves an optimization problem where:
% Inputs:
% - x0 - matrix of size [50x1]
% - xinit - matrix of size [6x1]
% - all_parameters - matrix of size [105x1]
% Outputs:
% - x1 - column vector of length 10
% - x2 - column vector of length 10
% - x3 - column vector of length 10
% - x4 - column vector of length 10
% - x5 - column vector of length 10
